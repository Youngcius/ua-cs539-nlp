# Assignment-3

## Objectives

The learning objectives of this assignment are to:
1. practice performing basic arithmetic on word vectors (e.g. cosine, etc). 
2. demonstrate building and using both sparse and dense word vectors
3. demonstrate loading word vectors from a file (GloVe embeddings)
4. practice calculating centroid vectors and tf.idf vectors
5. apply this knowledge to a multiple-choice question answering task.


## Test the code

Tests have been provided for you in the `test_vectors.py` file.
To run all the provided tests, run the ``pytest`` script from the directory
containing ``test_vectors.py``.
Initially, you will see output like:
```
